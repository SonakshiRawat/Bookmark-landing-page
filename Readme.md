<h2>BookMark Landing Page</h2>
<hr>
This is my solution to <strong>BookMark Landing Page</strong> challenge by Frontendmentor.io. which is based on simple HTML-CSS and javascript.This challenge will really test our layout skills. There are also areas that will require some JavaScript, such as the tabbed features section and the FAQ accordion.
